# Data Labelling

The folder for data labeling.

## Installation

Everything should be good to go for Windows. If you are on mac, you need to install LabelMe from [this URL](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases).

## Usage

1. Copy all of you images into the data/ folder. 
2. Double click start_labelme.bat. Should work on mac, let me know if it doesn't.
3. Click the ball label on the right to select the class you want (__ignore__ is for regions you want the ML to ignore, you shouldn't use it).
4. Right click on the image and select "Create Circle".
5. Everything auto-saves. Check the bottom right corner to see how many images you have left.
6. Re-upload the .json files to teams.
